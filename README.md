  # Indicator Importance Study
  This is a study to determine the best indicator to use when trading short-term.
  In order to determine the best indicator, we used a Linear Regression model, with many different indicators.  We then measured the amount of change that each indicator caused to the adjusted closing price 10 trading days in the future.  A higher change to the close price indicator a greater importance on that indicator.
  RESULTS:
    Bollinger Bands and Moving Averages were the best indicators.  RSI was one of the worst, as it is greatly overused in trading.
